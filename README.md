# polylogic 🧠

Hi, I’m a systems thinker with a love for abstract logic, elegant code, and big questions.

I build tools that explore:
- 🧪 Emergent behavior
- 🧭 Cognitive UIs
- 📚 Algorithmic philosophy
- 🔍 Visualization of truth, structure, and complexity

Tech I use:  
`TypeScript` · `Python` · `Rust` · `Next.js` · `D3.js` · `Django`

📍 If code can teach you something about the world, I’ll probably build it.
